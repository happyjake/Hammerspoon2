// This is called by the engine to inject types that we want to be available to JavaScript for users to directly instantiate.
// For many types this is not the case, so you should not expect this list to be exhaustive, nor should you add a new HS type here
// without thinking about whether it makes any sense for a user to be able to directly instantiate it.
// e.g. HSWindow does not belong here - for that to happen we would have to create a large number of static methods on the class
// that can do things like search for windows by name, and we would have to be able to fail the creation of a type.
// Better to keep those things in the module API, and keep HSWindow a narrowly-focused type that does not need to concern itself
// with such things.
